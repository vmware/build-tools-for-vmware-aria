## Introduction
This file serves as a guide to create a minimal infrastructure example using containers. We will be using [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) to orchestrate the following containers:

- [nginx](https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx)
- `Nexus`
  - [sonatype/nexus3](https://hub.docker.com/r/sonatype/nexus3/)
- `GitLab`
  - [gitlab/gitlab-ce](https://hub.docker.com/r/gitlab/gitlab-ce)
- [gitlab/gitlab-runner](https://hub.docker.com/r/gitlab/gitlab-runner)

Using these applications, the infrastructure will support source control, running the build pipeline as well as hosting and serving the artifact packages, which are all the minimal requirements to have an [Build Tools for VMware Aria](../README.md) project.

We will also be guiding you through configuring the applications and setting up a new project and building it end-to-end.

Please contribute back to this document if you find out of date contents or have other ways to improve it.

## Prerequisites

### Installation
Before proceeding, make sure you have the following installed on your system:
- [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) - Important to configure the docker host to automatically start after reboot and add docker to PATH.
    ```bash
    systemctl start docker
    systemctl enable docker
    export PATH=$PATH:~/.docker/bin
    ```
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install)


@TODO-STEF: SHOULD THIS EXIST?
- [Open JDK 17](https://openjdk.org/install/)
- [Maven 3.9+](https://maven.apache.org/)
- [NodeJS 22.x](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) - Recommended to use [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm) to manage Node versions.
@TODO-STEF: SHOULD THIS EXIST?

For Linux, besides Docker, you can use GitLab Runner's [Dockerfile](/infrastructure/gitlab-runner/Dockerfile) RUN commands to setup your environment.

### Validation
Validate all of the prerequisites are available in the Terminal:
```bash
docker -v
@TODO-STEF: SHOULD THIS EXIST?
node -v
mvn -v
java --version
@TODO-STEF: SHOULD THIS EXIST?
```

## Running the Infrastructure
To get started, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository containing the existing resources:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/vmware/build-tools-for-vmware-aria.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the `infrastructure` folder:
    ```bash
    cd build-tools-for-vmware-aria/infrastructure
    ```

4. Open the [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) file:
    - Check the IPs and port forwarding options for each of the containers and make sure they work for your specific setup. Leaving them as-is should work, provided you don't have port collisions with other applications. In case you change the ports, you will also need to make the changes in the nginx configuration file [nginx/conf.d/main.conf](./nginx/conf.d/main.conf).

5. Add the nginx container and the docker internal host endpoints to your `hosts` file.  
    - Docker provides an internal DNS server in user-defined networks (infranet) to resolve container names to their internal IP addresses. Since your nginx and GitLab services are part of the infranet network, they can communicate using their Docker defined hostnames.

    - We are going to be accessing the containers from the nginx reverse proxy. For this you need to manually edit the /etc/hosts file on your host machine:

    - Add the following records to the `/etc/hosts` file.
        ```text
        127.0.0.1 infra.corp.local
        ```

6. Run the [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) file:
    ```bash
    docker compose up -d
    ```

7. Validate the containers are created:
    ```bash
    docker ps
    ```

   The results should look something like this:
    ```text
    CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                    COMMAND                  CREATED         STATUS                   PORTS                                                 NAMES

    42630f6121ad   yrzr/gitlab-ce-arm64v8   "/assets/wrapper"        5 minutes ago   Up 5 minutes             0.0.0.0:8022->22/tcp, 0.0.0.0:8082->80/tcp            gitlab-ce
    17ba02a491e8   gitlab/gitlab-runner     "/usr/bin/dumb-init …"   5 minutes ago   Up 5 minutes             0.0.0.0:2811->2811/tcp                                gitlab-runner
    ```

8. Wait until all containers are up and running, which might take a few minutes:
    - nginx - [infra.corp.local](http://infra.corp.local)
    - Nexus - [infra.corp.local/nexus](http://infra.corp.local/nexus)
    - GitLab - [infra.corp.local/gitlab](http://infra.corp.local/gitlab)
    - GitLab Runner - [infra.corp.local/gitlab-runner](http://infra.corp.local/gitlab-runner) (*no http web interface*)

## Application Setup

### GitLab
1. Grab the GitLab `root` password:
    ```bash
    sudo docker exec -it gitlab-ce grep 'Password:' /etc/gitlab/initial_root_password
    ```
    *This file will be deleted 24 hours after a container restart*

2. Login at [http://infra.corp.local/gitlab/users/sign_in](http://infra.corp.local/gitlab/users/sign_in) with:
    ```text
    account: root
    password: *password from previous step*
    ```
3. Change the root user password at [http://infra.corp.local/gitlab/admin/users/root/edit](http://infra.corp.local/gitlab/admin/users/root/edit)

### GitLab Runner
1. Go to [http://infra.corp.local/gitlab/admin/runners](http://infra.corp.local/gitlab/admin/runners)
2. Click on `New instance runner`
3. Enter any tag, for instance `maven` and optionally select `Run untagged jobs` and press `Create runner`
4. Copy the code snippet in `Step 1`, which contains your AUTH_TOKEN and should look something like the following:
    ```bash
    gitlab-runner register --url http://infra.corp.local/gitlab --token <AUTH_TOKEN>
    ```
5. Append it to `docker exec -it gitlab-runner` and execute on your host:
    ```bash
    docker exec -it gitlab-runner gitlab-runner register --url http://infra.corp.local/gitlab --token <AUTH_TOKEN>
    ```
6. Follow the setup process by providing the following:
    - GitLab instance URL: leave `default` and press Enter
    - Enter a name for the runner: input `Maven` or leave `default` and press Enter
    - Enter an executor - input `shell` and press Enter
7. Go back to [http://infra.corp.local/gitlab/admin/runners](http://infra.corp.local/gitlab/admin/runners) and validate the runner is `Online`

### Nexus
1. Grab the Nexus `admin` password:
    ```bash
    docker exec nexus sh -c 'cat /nexus-data/admin.password && echo'
    ```
2. Login at [http://infra.corp.local/nexus/](http://infra.corp.local/nexus/) with:
    ```text
    account: admin
    password: *password from previous step*
    ```
3. Follow the initial setup wizard instructions:
    - Enter new `admin` password
    - Disable anonymous access

## Environment Setup
1. Follow the [Getting Started](../docs/versions/latest/General/Getting%20Started/) guides to setup your local environment.
2. Edit your local `~/.m2/settings.xml` by using the repository provided [settings.xml](/infrastructure/.m2/settings.xml). It should contain:
    - A nexus server authentication under `servers` with id `nexus` with your Nexus username and password.
    - A `Maven Central` mirror under `mirrors` with id `nexus`.
    - A profile under `profiles` with id `nexus` with `releases` and `snapshots` repositories.
    - A profile under `profiles` with id `packaging`.

    You can also copy it directly from the example [settings.xml](/infrastructure/.m2/settings.xml):
    ```bash
    mkdir -p ~/.m2
    cp .m2/settings.xml ~/.m2/settings.xml
    ```

## Project Setup @TODO-STEF: SHOULD THIS EXIST?
1. Create a repository called `demo` at [http://infra.corp.local/gitlab/projects/new#blank_project](http://infra.corp.local/gitlab/projects/new#blank_project).
2. Setup your local git environment and follow the `Command line instructions` listed in your new repo to clone it.
3. Open a terminal and `cd` to the repository directory.
4. Generate a project by running:
    ```bash
    mvn archetype:generate -DinteractiveMode=false -DarchetypeGroupId=com.vmware.pscoe.o11n.archetypes -DarchetypeArtifactId=package-ts-vra-ng-archetype -DarchetypeVersion=<VERSION> -DgroupId=local.corp -DartifactId=demo -DlicenseTechnicalPreview=false -DoutputDirectory=../
    ```
    where `<VERSION>` is the last released version or any specific version you want, i.e. `2.42.0`.

    You might also want to change the specific archetype to best fit your specific use-case. Check out the archetype templates available at [com.vmware.pscoe.o11n.archetypes](https://central.sonatype.com/namespace/com.vmware.pscoe.o11n.archetypes), some of them might need additional dependencies like `Powershell` or `Python`.
5. Validate the command generates the appropriate project files.
6. Validate you can build and test the project locally:
    ```bash
    mvn clean package
    mvn test
    ```
    You might need to comment out the following passage:
    ```text
    <dependency>
        <groupId>local.corp</groupId>
        <artifactId>vro</artifactId>
        <version>1.0.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
        <type>package</type>
    </dependency>
    ```
    in `vra`'s `pom.xml` in order to successfully build and test.

7. Configure the GitLab pipeline by creating a new file in the root of the repository named `.gitlab-ci.yml`:
    ```yml
    stages:
      - setup
      - build
      - test
      - install

    variables:
      LOCAL_REPO: >-
        -Dmaven.repo.local=$CI_PROJECT_DIR/.m2/repository    
      BUILD_OPTS: >-
        -Dhttps.protocols=TLSv1.2
        $LOCAL_REPO
        -DskipTests=true
      DEPLOY_OPTS: >-
        -Dhttps.protocols=TLSv1.2
        $LOCAL_REPO
        -DskipTests=true
        -Dbuild.number=$CI_PIPELINE_IID
        -Dsurefire.useSystemClassLoader=false
        -Pbundle-with-installer
        -DoutputDirectory=target
        -DartifactName=artifact.zip
        -U
        --batch-mode

    dynamic_variables:
      stage: setup
      script:
        - echo "GROUP_ID=$(mvn help:evaluate $LOCAL_REPO -Dexpression=project.groupId -q -DforceStdout)" >> build.env
        - echo "ARTIFACT_ID=$(mvn help:evaluate $LOCAL_REPO -Dexpression=project.artifactId -q -DforceStdout)" >> build.env
        - echo "PROJECT_VERSION=$(mvn help:evaluate $LOCAL_REPO -Dexpression=project.version -q -DforceStdout)" >> build.env
      artifacts:
        expire_in: 3 hours
        reports:
          dotenv: build.env

    build:
      stage: build
      script:
        - mvn $BUILD_OPTS clean package

    test:
      stage: test
      script:
        - mvn $LOCAL_REPO test

    install:
      stage: install
      needs: ["dynamic_variables"]
      script:
        - mvn $DEPLOY_OPTS clean package deploy
      artifacts:
        paths:
          - vra/target/*.zip
          - vro/target/*.zip
        name: "$GROUP_ID.$ARTIFACT_ID-$PROJECT_VERSION-$CI_PIPELINE_IID"
        expire_in: 1 month
    ```
    *For more information about the GitLab pipelines, see the pipeline documentation at [https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/)*

8. Commit and push your git repository changes
9. Validate `GitLab` runs the pipelines successfully:
    - Head to [http://infra.corp.local/gitlab/root/demo/-/pipelines](http://infra.corp.local/gitlab/root/demo/-/pipelines) and wait for all of the `setup`, `build`, `test` and `install` steps to run successfully on the the pipeline run you just triggered by pushing in Step #8.
    - After done, check that you can see the `install:archive` artifact from the successful pipeline outputs (*download button on the right side of the run*) or by going to the artifacts page at [http://infra.corp.local/gitlab/root/demo/-/artifacts](http://infra.corp.local/gitlab/root/demo/-/artifacts)
    - Pressing the `install:archive` artifact or downloading the *.zip* directly should start a download of the `local.corp.demo-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-1.zip` install bundle.
10. You can continue by:
    - following the [Bundle Installer Guide](../docs/archive/doc/markdown/use-bundle-isntaller.md) to push your package to your `Aria` instance manually.
    - adding a new `profile` in the [settings.xml](./.m2/settings.xml) for your `Aria` instance and then executing `mvn package vrealize:push -P<NEW_PROFILE_NAME>` which will push your changes directly to a life environment. Follow the [Push](../docs/archive/doc/markdown/use-workstation-vra-ng-project.md#Push) section of your specific archetype documentation at [docs/archive/doc/markdown](../docs/archive/doc/markdown/).

## Conclusion
This concludes the setup. You now have a fully operational end-to-end architecture to support the [Build Tools for Aria](../README.md), create, build and push projects and run pipelines that produce install bundles.

*This is not intended as a production environment, but as an educational sandbox. You should setup your proper and persistent development and production environments in a similar fashion.*
