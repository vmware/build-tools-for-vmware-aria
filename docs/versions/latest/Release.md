## Breaking Changes

[//]: # (### *Breaking Change*)
[//]: # (Describe the breaking change AND explain how to resolve it)
[//]: # (You can utilize internal links /e.g. link to the upgrade procedure, link to the improvement|deprecation that introduced this/)
### *Upgrade to node.js 22 (22.13.1)*
BTVA is compiled for node.js 22 and may use features not available in older node.js versions. Make sure proper version of node.js is used for project build.
Projects that use older versions of @types/node should upgrade to the later versions compatible with node.js 22. Changes in code using obsolete functions may be required.

### *Upgrade to latest typescipt and ts-node*
The latest versions of typescipt have stricter code validation and may report errors where they were previously ignored.
Examples: not passing all mandatory function parameters, use of 'this' in workflow definitions (*.wf.ts).

### *Aria (vra-ng) policies are now handled differently.*

Previously, when pulling and pushing policies, duplicates were allowed, however this didn't allow us to map them correctly. So that being the case, now policies with the same name and of the same type on the environment will break the execution of the code.

## Deprecations

[//]: # (### *Deprecation*)
[//]: # (Explain what is deprecated and suggest alternatives)

[//]: # (Features -> New Functionality)
### *Angular 8 not supported for VCD projects*
The VCD projects based on Angular 8 templates are not supported anymore. Projects must be upgraded to Angular 15 templates.

### *Remove powershell runtime option*
The following option have been removed:
```text
- `powershell:7.4`
```

## Improvements

### VcPlugin types

#### Previous behaviour

VcPlugin types fromString() took the type itself as parameter. The method was not labelled as static, this was leftover from when the types were declared as an interface rather than as a class.

#### New behaviour

VcPlugin types fromString() take a string as a parameter and the method is now correctly labelled as static.

### *Fix documentation typo*

It is now possible to configure how the unit tests are being bootstrapped and executed.

#### Previous Behavior

Missing a close curly brace in the Workflow's User Interaction example.

#### New Behavior

The example now has a close curly brace.

#### Relevant Documentation

## Upgrade procedure

[//]: # (Explain in details if something needs to be done)

For older vCD projects which are not buildable with Node 22 you can:
* Build them as a separate project
* Use Node version manager to dynamically switch between Node versions during build phases of the different subprojects
* Utilise Maven goals and plugins to dynamically switch to earlier Node version in the vCD project's pom.xml
