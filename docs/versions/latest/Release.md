### *Aria (vra-ng) policies are now handled differently.*

Previously, when pulling and pushing policies, duplicates were allowed, however this didn't allow us to map them correctly. So that being the case, now policies with the same name and of the same type on the environment will break the execution of the code.

## Improvements

### VcPlugin types

#### Previous behaviour

VcPlugin types fromString() took the type itself as parameter. The method was not labelled as static, this was leftover from when the types were declared as an interface rather than as a class.

#### New behaviour

VcPlugin types fromString() take a string as a parameter and the method is now correctly labelled as static.
