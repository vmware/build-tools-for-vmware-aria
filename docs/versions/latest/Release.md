### _vRA data collection is now forcefully triggered_

Till this moment, we used to have **vrang.data.collection.delay.seconds** property, which is waiting for defined period so that automatic data collection to happen in vRA for vRO items (through vRO integration made in vRA). New feature allows forcefully to execute data collection instead to wait for given period. If forced data collection fails, old mechanism will continue working as of now.
Note that data collection will be forced only in case **vrang.data.collection.delay.seconds** is defined and it is more than 0 seconds.
