### Pretty formatted JSON for Custom Forms when storing them together with Custom Form Metadata
When Custom Forms are pulled from Aria Automation, they are stored on the file system (the repo) in a form similar to
```json
{
  "id": "e694a748-7067-47d1-91a4-614da73dda03",
  "name": "Test",
  "form": "{\"layout\": {...},\"schema\": {...},\"options\": {...}}",
  "styles": null,
  "sourceType": "com.vmw.blueprint",
  "sourceId": "71ac6ebc-6a94-3c5a-8c00-2a44ddf81bce",
  "type": "requestForm",
  "status": "ON",
  "formFormat": "JSON"
}
```
Here, please note that the form field is a double serialized JSON as string : "{"layout": {...},"schema": {...},"options": {...}}"
which makes it goes in one line and very difficult for a human to work with. If there is any commits and. changes in the form in the repo, the diffs are very difficult to find (when reviewing pull requests).
As a whole it is not human friendly and very difficult for a human to deal with.

The current pull request, makes it so that the format will become a properly formatted JSON object like:
```json
{
  "id": "e694a748-7067-47d1-91a4-614da73dda03",
  "name": "Test",
  "form": {
    "layout": {
    ...
    },
    "schema": {
    ...
    },
    "options": {
    ...
    }
  },
  "styles": null,
  "sourceType": "com.vmw.blueprint",
  "sourceId": "71ac6ebc-6a94-3c5a-8c00-2a44ddf81bce",
  "type": "requestForm",
  "status": "ON",
  "formFormat": "JSON"
}
```
This way it is more easy to work with.

### Enable support for binding workflow attributes to Configuration Element variables
Be able to bind attribute values to Configuration Element variables

To do that one have to provide the following annotation for the workflow ts file (SomeFile.wf.ts)
```json
@Workflow({
        id: "<Some Id>",
        name: "<Some Name>",
        path: "<Some Path>",
        attributes: {
            attributeName: {
            type: "string",
            bind: true,   
            value: "Some/Path/To/ConfigurationElement/variableName"
            }
        }
    })
```
Here
`bind: true` - means that we have to bind the value of the attribute to Configuration Element variable.
`value: "Some/Path/To/ConfigurationElement/variableName"` - points to the Configuration Element and variable inside the Configuration Element to bind to.

## Improvements

### Add missing types to AD Plugin

### Republish the same tenants on VCD Plugin upgrade

Republish the same tenants on VCD plugin upgrade instead of publish to all tenants.

#### Previous Behavior
* On vcd plugin upgrade, the plugin will published to all tenants.

#### New Behavior
* On vcd plugin upgrade, the plugin will published only for already published tenants.

### Fix on legacy archetype failing with vro:pull (when workflow folder path name contains special characters(&))

#### Previous Behaviour

When executing a vro:pull command on a legacy archetype, the command will fail without proper error if the workflow paths contains special characters such as '&'.

#### Current Behaviour

When executing a vro:pull command on a legacy archetype, if the workflows paths contains special character(&), the command will fail but will provide descriptive error message.

### Fix SSH Session methods type

#### Previous Behavior

When using SSH with typescript, the `error` and `state` methods has the type `void`. But technically, it returns a string. VSCode highlight it as an error and the complication failed. The same method is working in JS (obviously). Example from the built-in Workflow. Variable `error` and `state` has type `String`.

#### Current Behavior

Method `error` and `state` should return type `String` instead of type `void`


### Upgrade VCD archetype to support Angular 15
VMware Cloud Director v10.6 is going to drop support for Angular v9 or less.

#### Previous Behaviour
VMware Cloud Director archetype is using:
* node v12
* angular v8
* clarity v2
* rxjs v6
* webpack v4

The old archetype can still be bootstrapped with:
`mvn archetype:generate \
    -DinteractiveMode=false \
    -DarchetypeGroupId=com.vmware.pscoe.vcd.archetypes \
    -DarchetypeArtifactId=package-vcd-ng-angular8-archetype \
    -DgroupId=org.example \
    -DartifactId=sample \
    -DlicenseUrl= \
    -DlicenseHeader= \
    -DlicenseTechnicalPreview=false`

#### Current Behaviour
VMware Cloud Director archetype is using:
* node v16+
* angular v15
* clarity v15
* rxjs v7
* webpack v5

The new archetype can be bootstrapped with:
`mvn archetype:generate \
    -DinteractiveMode=false \
    -DarchetypeGroupId=com.vmware.pscoe.vcd.archetypes \
    -DarchetypeArtifactId=package-vcd-ng-archetype \
    -DgroupId=org.example \
    -DartifactId=sample \
    -DlicenseUrl= \
    -DlicenseHeader= \
    -DlicenseTechnicalPreview=false`
