### *Bugfix for failure to find imported module of Powershell 7 polyglot action*

#### Previous Behavior

Executing a PowerShell 7 polyglot action with an imported module results in an error of the type "The specified module '...' was not loaded because no valid module file was found in any module directory."

#### New Behavior

On Windows, if which() fails, try using the command directly as the shell can resolve Windows App execution aliases that which() cannot detect.
