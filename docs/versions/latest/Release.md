### Fix on legacy archetype failing with vro:pull (when workflow folder path name contains special characters(&))

#### Previous Behavior

When executing a vro:pull command on a legacy archetype, the command will fail without proper error if the workflow paths contains special characters such as '&'.

#### Current Behavior

When executing a vro:pull command on a legacy archetype, if the workflows paths contains special character(&), the command will fail but will provide descriptive error message.

### Fix SSH Session methods type

#### Previous Behavior

When using SSH with typescript, the `error` and `state` methods has the type `void`. But technically, it returns a string. VSCode highlight it as an error and the complication failed. The same method is working in JS (obviously). Example from the built-in Workflow. Variable `error` and `state` has type `String`.

#### Current Behavior

Method `error` and `state` should return type `String` instead of type `void`

### Fix SSH Session additional methods type

#### Previous Behavior

When using SSH with typescript, the  `cmd`, `pty`, `terminal` methods has the type `void`. But technically, it returns a string. VSCode highlight it as an error and the complication failed. The same method is working in JS (obviously). Example from the built-in Workflow. Variable  `cmd`, `pty`, `terminal` has type `String`.

#### Current Behavior

Method  `cmd`, `pty`, `terminal` should return type `String` instead of type `void`

### Upgrade VCD archetype to support Angular 15
VMware Cloud Director v10.6 is going to drop support for Angular v9 or less.

#### Previous Behaviour
VMware Cloud Director archetype is using:
* node v12
* angular v8
* clarity v2
* rxjs v6
* webpack v4

The old archetype can still be bootstrapped with:
`mvn archetype:generate \
    -DinteractiveMode=false \
    -DarchetypeGroupId=com.vmware.pscoe.vcd.archetypes \
    -DarchetypeArtifactId=package-vcd-ng-angular8-archetype \
    -DgroupId=org.example \
    -DartifactId=sample \
    -DlicenseUrl= \
    -DlicenseHeader= \
    -DlicenseTechnicalPreview=false`

#### Current Behaviour
VMware Cloud Director archetype is using:
* node v16+
* angular v15
* clarity v15
* rxjs v7
* webpack v5

The new archetype can be bootstrapped with:
`mvn archetype:generate \
    -DinteractiveMode=false \
    -DarchetypeGroupId=com.vmware.pscoe.vcd.archetypes \
    -DarchetypeArtifactId=package-vcd-ng-archetype \
    -DgroupId=org.example \
    -DartifactId=sample \
    -DlicenseUrl= \
    -DlicenseHeader= \
    -DlicenseTechnicalPreview=false`
