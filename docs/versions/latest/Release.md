## Improvements

### *Fixed: Failed to push TS project to vRO 9.0 #836*

#### Previous Behavior
Push and pull operations failed with a `...push failed: Expected to find an object with property ['versionInfo']...` when authenticating against standalone VRO 9.
Reason the version of VRA is checked regardless the selected auth type. In environments with standalone VRO the error above occures.

#### New Behavior
Authentication strategies have been updated to better support standalone vRO 9 environments.

* **Basic Auth:** When `<vro.auth>basic</vro.auth>` is configured in `settings.xml`, the authentication strategy now executes without performing a vRA version check.
* **vRA Auth:** The vRA version check is now strictly limited to configurations using `<vro.auth>vra</vro.auth>`.
