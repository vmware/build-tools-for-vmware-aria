### *Fix `vrops` archetype project generation*

#### Previous Behavior
Project generation from `vrops` archetype fails because Maven tries to replace a variable inside a defined supermetric due to filtering functionality and `${}` symbol.

#### New Behavior
Project generation from `vrops` archetype executes successfully. Maven configuration is updated to not use variable replacement on `src/main/resources` since content there needs to be directly copied.
