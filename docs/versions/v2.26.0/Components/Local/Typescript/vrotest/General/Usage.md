# Usage
Provides detailed instructions on how to use vrotest

## Overview
The usage is divided in 2 steps
* build -> Builds the test bed
* run -> Runs the unit tests

If `mvn clean test` is run inside of the created project, build will be executed after which run will be called.

  --coverage-thresholds         Defines the threshold (in %) for the test coverage. Tests will fail if coverage is below the threshold.
                                Format: <error>:<warn>:<type>
                                Types:

                                  * statements
  --coverage-reports            Specify test coverage reports to use.
                                Availale values:
                                  * text

  --per-file                    Code coverage per file bases. Set custom --coverage-thresholds, if any file in the project drops below those thresholds, the build will fail
