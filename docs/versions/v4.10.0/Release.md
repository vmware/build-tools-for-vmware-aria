# v4.10.0

## Breaking Changes


## Deprecations



## Features


### *Add SSH timeout common configuration*

Common configuration for timeout on SSH operations is added that can be used by any archetype that needs it.
The new timeout has the following configuration options:
* <vrealize.ssh.timeout> - in `settings.xml` profile
* vrealize_ssh_timeout - as `installer` script input
* default value of 300 if not provided

### *Add support for User Interaction Custom Forms push in Typescript based projects*

In release 2.44.0 support for `@UserInteractionItem` decorator for `Workflows` was added which enables the user to define `User Interaction` Workflow components in Typescript based project but was limitted to pushing a default empty `Custom Form`.

The current feature enables the user to push `User Interaction Custom Forms` provided as a JSON definitions in separate files similar to the already supported `Workflow Custom Forms` push. The file needs to be placed in the same folder as the related `.wf.ts` file and must follow naming convention: `{{workflowFileName}}_input_form_{{userInteractionItemId}}.wf.form.json` where:
* `workflowFileName` - is the actual file name of the `.wf.ts` definition file (which might be different from the `Workflow` name defined in the `name` key inside the `@Workflow` decorator parameters).
* `userInteractionItemId` - the ID of the `User Interaction` component as defined in the UI (autogenerated if the component is manually added to the `Workflow` schema) or in the JSON definition under `itemId` key.

Example file structure:
```ascii
service-automation
├── README.md
├── pom.xml
├── release.sh
├── tsconfig.json
└── src
    └── integration-service-1
        └── workflows
            └── CreateIntegration.wf.ts
            └── CreateIntegration.wf.form.json
            └── CreateIntegration_input_form_item2.wf.form.json
```

If no `Custom Form` file definition is provided (or the naming convention is not properly followed) the default empty definition is used.


## Improvements


### *Add SSH timeout to vROps operations*

Use the newly introduced SSH timeout common configuration in vROps push/pull operations.

#### Previous Behavior

SSH operations have no timeout which in certain scenarios results in hanging push/pull operation.

#### New Behavior

SSH operations use the configured (or default) timeout value and if reached - the push/pull operation fails.

### *Update documention for import strategies*

Add documentation about `importOldVersions` import strategy and update documentation for `forceImportLatestVersions`. Add missing log in case of skipped import of package when using `forceImportLatestVersions`.
