Here you will learn the needed steps on how to configure the artifactory

### Configuring Artifactory
Note that the libs-release, libs-snapshot etc. are the default Maven repositories created by JFrog's **Quick Setup**
shown at first login. This guide assumes that this **Quick Setup** has been executed.
1. Create a local repository in artifactory to contain the toolchain artifacts, e.g. **vrealize-build-tools**
   and add it to the virtual release repository (e.g. **libs-release**)
2. Create a remote repository and configure the maven central public repository (https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/).
   Add it to the virtual release repository (e.g. **libs-release**). This is needed so any public dependencies can be
   downloaded as well.

### Configure permissions for local cache for the Anonymous user
1. Login into Artifactory with admin privileges
2. Navigate to **Admin > Permissions**
3. Click the **New** button
4. Add a name for the permissions (for example: Anonymous Cache)
5. Add all repositories into the **Selected Repositories** list view
6. Skip the groups section
7. On the **Users** section add **Anonymous** user
8. Give **Deploy/Cache, Annotate, Read** permissions
9. Click **Save & Finish**

### Uploading toolchain artifacts to Artifactory

#### Via Cli
1. Unzip **iac-maven-repository.zip** found at **artifacts/maven/** path relative to the root of the
   toolchain bundle to a folder, e.g. **import/**
2. Go to the directory where you have unzipped the archive. Your working directory should contain the "com" folder and
   the **archetype-catalog.xml** file, e.g.:
```bash
root@photon-G6H8GzV2j [ ~/toolchain/import ]# ls
archetype-catalog.xml  com
```
3. Run `jfrog config add` to configure your local environment with the artifactory server.
4. Then, run the following command ``jfrog rt u --recursive=true --flat=false ./* vrealize-build-tools``,
   where **vrealize-build-tools** should be the name of the repository you've created at step #1 in [Configuring Artifactory](#configuring-artifactory).
5. Examine the output of the command. It should look something similar to this:
```
Uploading artifact: /path/to/artifact/some-artifact.jar
{
  "status": "success",
  "totals": {
    "success": 1,
    "failure": 0
  }
}
```
**Note:** There is a chance that not all of the artifacts will be uploaded (you will be getting a lot of errors).
If this happens, you can re-run the command.

### Upload vRO artifacts to Artifactory (if needed)
First you need access to a supported version of vRO appliance to get the vRO dependencies for the toolchain in your artifactory.
1. Get all vRO artifacts on the local machine. Run:
```bash
wget --no-check-certificate --recursive --no-parent --reject "index.html*" https://<vro_ip>:<vro_port>/vco-repo/com/
wget --no-check-certificate --recursive --no-parent --reject "index.html*" https://<vro_ip>:<vro_port>/vco-repo/com/vmware/o11n/mojo/pkg/
wget --no-check-certificate --recursive --no-parent --reject "index.html*" https://<vro_ip>:<vro_port>/vco-repo/com/vmware/o11n/pkg
```
2. Create a new local repository (e.g. **vro-local**) and add it to the virtual release repository (e.g. **libs-release**).
3. Navigate to the root folder of the downloaded repository on the local filesystem - at the same level as the **com**
   directory. E.g.:
```bash
root@photon-G6H8GzV2j [ ~/192.168.71.1/vco-repo ]# ls
com
```
4. Import the vro artifacts to the selected repository, for example:
```
jfrog rt u --recursive true --flat false ./* vro-local
```
