# Core Concepts

## Overview

We can run any existing workflow automatically at the end of the installation process and pass to the workflow all necessary parameters of different types. Supported types are:

- string
- number
- boolean
- Array/string

All other types except mentioned bellow will be send as parameter of type `string`. The most common case of today is to use this feature for running `Install` workflow.
