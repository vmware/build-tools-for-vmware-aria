# Getting Started
Here you will find information on how to easily get onboarded working with Build Tools for VMware Aria.

## Overview
Build Tools for VMware Aria relies on a private artifact manager like JFrog Artifactory OSS ( no limitation to it being public,
but possibly not desirable ). Here you will find instructions on how to setup such an environment. 

Build Tools for VMware Aria also has some local dependencies that need to be configured and we will talk about them as well.
