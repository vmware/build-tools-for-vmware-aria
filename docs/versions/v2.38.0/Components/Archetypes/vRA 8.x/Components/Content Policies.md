### Structure
Below is an example structure of content policies export.

Example `content.yaml`
```yaml
policy:
  approval:
    - example policy
  content-sharing:
    - example policy
  day2-actions:
    - example policy
  deployment-limit:
    - example policy
  lease:
    - example policy
  resource-quota: 
    - example policy

# ...
```

Structure
```ascii
src/
├─ main/
│  ├─ resources/
│  │  ├─ policies/
│  │  │  ├─ approval/
│  │  │  │  ├─ examplePolicy.json
│  │  │  ├─ content-sharing/
│  │  │  │  ├─ examplePolicy.json
│  │  │  ├─ day2-actions/
│  │  │  │  ├─ examplePolicy.json
│  │  │  ├─ deployment-limit/
│  │  │  │  ├─ examplePolicy.json
│  │  │  ├─ lease/
│  │  │  │  ├─ examplePolicy.json
│  │  │  ├─ resource-quota/
│  │  │  │  ├─ examplePolicy.json
```
### Operations

Operations are invoked on policies based on filtering from content.yml file, according to the following rules:

- Empty array [] - nothing is imported/exported.
- List of items - the given items are imported/exported. If they are not present on the server an Exception is thrown.  
- Null (nothing given) - everything is being imported/exported.


#### Importing
When importing policies, files are read form the filesystem, and the content.yml filter is by filename. All non-hidden files are read from the folder, and if the name of the file, without the extension matches the list in content.yml, the policy will be imported.
The filename is only important for filtering. Actual policy fields are read from the file contents.
If there is a policy with the same id on the server, an update will be performed. Otherwise, the policy will be created instead, using the same id, that is found in the file.
On import the organization will be changed to match the receiving organization.
Project Id will also be changed, but only if present, and if the organization has also been changed.

#### Exporting
When exporting a policy, a json file will be created on the filesystem. The filename will be the policyName[-index].json.
Index will be added only if there are multiple policies with the same name.
### Known Issues

Re-Creating Deleted policy.
If you delete a policy, and then try to re-import it immediately, the import command will not fail, however, the policy will not be created.
After a certain delay, the policy can be re-created again  via vrealize:push.
"Open bug: [VRAE-61849]"

Here are two approaches to prevent this from happening:
- **Do not delete policies before re-importing them.** This approach will only work if you do not need to change some properties like projectId.
- **Remove policy ids from JSON files.** After successful import, do a export to get the new policyIds in the JSON files again. This approach will only work if you are exporting and importing from a single site. If you are exporting from SiteA to SiteB regularly, this may lead to policy duplicates.
