# Getting Started
Here you will find information on how to easily get onboarded working with vRBT.

## Overview
vRBT relies on a private artifact manager like JFrog Artifactory OSS ( no limitation to it being public,
but possibly not desirable ). Here you will find instructions on how to setup such an environment. 

vRBT also has some local dependencies that need to be configured and we will talk about them as well.
