## v1.5.10 - 19 Apr 2019

### Enhancements

* Include CHANGELOG.md in the final tool chain bundle.

## v1.5.9 - 19 Apr 2019

### Enhancements

* `vro:pull`, `vra:pull` and `vra:auth` Maven goals now support the SSL verification flags to be set as properties in a Maven profile, similarly to the `vrealize:push` goal.

### Fixes

* When using the Bundle Installer with a properties file the value of `vro_delete_old_versions` used to be ignored - if the property was present, the installer would do the cleanup. Now, if the property is not present it is considered false. If it is present, however, its value will be used to opt-in for the cleanup.

## v1.5.8 - 15 Apr 2019

### Enhancements

* Support for gradual migration from JS-based projects to TypeScript ones by allowing .js files in src/ folder to be respected at TS copilation stage.
* Support for vRO resource elements to be included in package. TS projects can contain any files that are not .ts and .js under src/ directory and those will carried over.
* (internal) Improvement of unit-test parallel execution and sub-suite instantiation for easier debugging/testing purposes.

## v1.5.7 - 03 Apr 2019

### Enhancements

* Installer CLI now prompts for SSL verification flags. Default is still to verify the certificate against Java's key store (i.e. cacerts) and to verify the hostname. Those flags can be persisted and controlled via the environment's `.properties` file.
* vrealize:push Maven goal now supports the SSL verification flags to be set as properties in a Maven profile, i.e. you can add `<vrealize.ssl.ignore.certificate>true</vrealize.ssl.ignore.certificate>` under `<properties>` in an active Maven profile to skip the certificate verification against JAVA's key store (i.e. cacerts). You can also add `<vrealize.ssl.ignore.hostname>true</vrealize.ssl.ignore.hostname>` to skip the hostname verification. **WARNING** this is intended for use with production endpoints. For those cases, register vRA/vRO certificate in Java's key store and access the endpoint using its FQDN.

## v1.5.6 - 27 Mar 2019

### Enhancements

* **BREAKING** All certificates are now verified as part of API calls from the toolchain to vRA/vRO:
  * Verify hostname - the hostname if the vRO/vRA server should match the CN of the SSL certificate. *For development environments, this can be skipped by a flag described in documentation.*
  * Verify certificate - the SSL certificate used by vRO/vRA is verified against the Java default keystore, i.e. `cacerts`. Self-signed or third-party certificates have to either be addded to the trusted store (or their CA) or the check can be ignored for development environments by a flag described in documentation.

* Improved logging when installing packages - logs will report which package will be included (pass) and which will be excluded (skip).
* `vrealize:push` will import all packages per type in a single batch, reporting what will be included (pass) and excluded (skip).

### Fixes

* Installer overwrites newer versions of packages found on the server if a concrete source package, e.g. v1.0.2 is not found.
* `vrealize:push` downgrades dependent packages, i.e. it will always forcefully install the concrete versions of the dependencies regardless of the state of the target vRO/vRA server. This is still possible if an additianal flag is passed to the command: `-Dvro.importOldVersions` and respectively `-Dvra.importOldVersions`.

## v1.5.5 - 14 Mar 2019

### Fixes

* Pulling a vRO actions project from a Windows workstation leads to wrong identation in actions JavaScript files.

## v1.5.4 - 13 Mar 2019

### Fixes

* Issue related to vRO multi-tenantcy authentication. When toolchain worked with a vRO in a multi-tenant mode it tooked tenant name as domain name instead of the real domain name for login which caused authentication issues for non-default tenants.
* Issue related to the unit-tests executor of vRO actions-based projects on Windows. Inability to run unit-tests on Windows development workstation.
* Regression issue related to import/export of vRA composite blueprints for vRA versions before 7.4, as custom forms API is not supported in these versions.

### Known Issues

* VS Code Extension and Maven plugins cannot work against default tenant (vsphere.local) and custom tenant at the same time, when vRO is configured in a multi-tenant mode. This limitations comes from multi-tenant implementation in vRO where Resource Elements created in the default tenant are read-only for all other tenants.
  This issue could be worked around by not usting the toolchain against default tenant in multi-tenant environment.

## v1.5.3 - 05 Mar 2019

## v1.5.2 - 28 Feb 2019

## v1.5.1 - 11 Feb 2019

### Fixes

* Excessive collection triggering and 100 percent CPU usage for several minutes when VSCode auto-saving is enabled or frequent saves are used.
  * Collection will be triggered only if files are created or deleted instead of on each change.
  * Collection will be delayed with 10 seconds - that way when pulling many files the multiple change events will trigger only one colelction.
* Run Action command now supports vRO 7.3 and lower.
* Untitled files and files without IIFE now have correct autocompletion.

### Known Issues

* Cannot build project generated with groupId or artifactId that contain special characters.
  * Cause: The Jasmine tests are unable to compile if the folder hierarchy contains characters that are not allowed in Java packages.

  * Cause: The Jasmine tests are unable to compile if the folder hierarchy contains characters that are not allowed in Java packages.
  * Workaround: If a generated project contains special characters in its groupId or artifactId, rename all subfolders in test/ and src/ to not include any non-compatible with the Java package convention characters.
* Exporting vRA blueprints without custom forms logs error message "null". This is a bug in underling REST client library.

## v1.4.1 - 01 Feb 2019

### Enhancements

      "!com.vmware.pscoe.library*", // Exclude everything, except PSCoE libraries
      "com.vmware.pscoe.!(library*)", // Exclude everything PSCoE, except libraries
      "com.vmware.pscoe.library:{nsx,vra,vc}", // Exclude nsx, vra and vc libraries

When a package is build with `mvn package -Pbundle-with-installer` this will produce a zip file with all the dependencies and a bin/ and repo/ folders. The bundle can be installed by unziping it and calling ./bin/installer.
* Archetype generated projects now work with release.sh immediately, i.e. without further modifying the pom.xml file of the root project. You can still have the SCM remote written in the POM and not specify it every time, but OOTB after you add the project to SCM and add your remote (origin) you can use the `-r` option of the **release.sh** script: `sh ./release.sh -r $(git remote get-url origin)`.

All components of the toolchain now use the connection settings defined in the Maven profile at `~/.m2/settings.xml`. The exact profile to be used by the VSCode extension is provided by a new setting `o11n.maven.profile`.
* More build and deploy tasks are available in the `Cmd+Shift+B` palette in VSCode. The actual command behind each of these tasks can be overwritten by a project local `.vscode/tasks.json` file (`Cmd+Shift+B` -> click the cogwheel icon for a task -> change the command in the generated tasks.json).

### Migration Steps

* Since v1.2.0, all mixed projects that have to use vRA SSO authentication, should have the following added to their root **pom.xml** file.

  ```xml
  <parent>
      <groupId>com.vmware.pscoe.o11n</groupId>
      <artifactId>base-package</artifactId>
      <version>1.2.0</version>
  </parent>
  ```

* `o11n.maven.profile` setting is now required by the VSCode extension.

### Fixes

* Print a warning when `push` is executed for unsupported artifact types, instead of throwing an exception.
* Fix the 'Extension 'vmw-pscoe.o11n-vscode-extension' uses a document selector without scheme.' error visible in vscode when activating the vRO extension.

### Removed

* The `o11n.server.*` configuration properties for the VSCode extension are no longer used. They are replaced by the settings defined `o11n.maven.profile`.
* Removed Maven-based hint collection.

### Known Issues

* Cannot build project generated with groupId or artifactId that contain special characters.
  * Cause: The Jasmine tests are unable to compile if the folder hierarchy contains characters that are not allowed in Java packages.
  * Workaround: If a generated project contains special characters in its groupId or artifactId, rename all subfolders in test/ and src/ to not include any non-compatible with the Java package convention characters.
