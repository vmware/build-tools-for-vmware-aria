# General
## This file contains glob patterns for file paths to be ignored during compilation, packaging and testing.
## The file will be (re)generated when the project is rebuilt to maintain the default categories and patterns, ignoring blank lines and repeating comments.
## The default categories, defined as rows starting with a single '#', are 'General', 'Packaging', 'Compilation', 'Testing', 'TestHelpers'.
## Patterns not under one of those categories will be considered in the 'General' category and ignored during all operations.
## Patterns must be listed on separate rows (without in-line comments), can be negated with a single '!' at the start and will be trimmed before processing.
## The 'TestHelpers'category will contain these two patterns by default: '**/*_helper.js', '**/*.helper.[tj]s'
## Rows starting with '##' are considered as comments and will be ignored on processing.
# Packaging
## Files with these paths will not be included in the vro package
# Compilation
## Files with these paths will be compiled without TS definitions
# Testing
## Files with these paths will be excluded from test coverage
# TestHelpers
## Files with these paths will be included in the tests but will not have TS definitions and will not be included in the test coverage or the vro package
**/*_helper.js
**/*.helper.[tj]s
