## Submitting a Pull Request

Please follow the instructions in the [PR template](./pull_request_template.md).

## Reporting Issues

If you have identified a reproducible problem or have a feature request, please [open an Issue](https://github.com/vmware/{{ repo-url }}/issues/new/choose).

### Look For an Existing Issue

Before you create a new issue, please do a search in [open issues](https://github.com/vmware/{{ repo-url }}/issues) to see if the issue or feature request has already been filed.

If you find your issue already exists, make relevant comments and add your [reaction](https://github.com/blog/2119-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments). Use a reaction in place of a "+1" comment (üëç for upvote or üëé for downvote).

If you cannot find an existing issue that describes your bug or feature, create a new issue using the guidelines below.

### Writing Good Issue Reports

-   File a single issue per problem and feature request. Do not enumerate multiple bugs or feature requests in the same issue.
-   Do not add your issue as a comment to an existing issue unless it's related. Many issues look similar, but have different causes.
-   When filing bugs, please follow the [bug template](./ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md) and include as much information as possible. The more information you can provide, the more likely someone will be successful at reproducing the issue and finding a fix.
