2.	LICENSE GRANT, USE AND OWNERSHIP.

       (a)  Limited License.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, VMware grants to Licensee a non-exclusive, non-transferable license (without the right to sublicense) (i) to use the Technology Preview Software in accordance with the Documentation solely for purposes of internal testing and evaluation, (ii) to use the Documentation provided with the Technology Preview Software in support of Licensee’s authorized use of the Technology Preview Software, and (iii) to copy the Technology Preview Software for archival or backup purposes, provided that all titles and trademarks, copyright, and restricted rights notices are reproduced on such copies.

In furtherance of this purpose, Licensee shall provide feedback to VMware concerning the functionality and performance of the Technology Preview Software from time to time as reasonably requested by VMware, including, without limitation, identifying potential errors and improvements.  Licensee will provide the requested feedback in a manner that is convenient to Licensee subject to reasonable availability of Licensee’s personnel.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to Licensee disclosing to VMware any information under this Agreement that Licensee considers proprietary or confidential, Licensee shall obtain VMware’s prior written approval to disclose such information to VMware, and without such prior written approval from VMware, Licensee shall not disclose any such information to VMware.  VMware may use feedback to improve or enhance its products and, accordingly, you hereby grant to VMware a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, transferable, worldwide right and license, with the right to sublicense, to use, reproduce, disclose, distribute, perform, display, modify, prepare derivative works of and otherwise exploit the feedback and other information without restriction in any manner now known or in the future conceived and to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and export any product or service that incorporates the feedback and other information.
       
       (c)  Restrictions. Licensee shall not copy or use the Technology Preview Software (including the Documentation) except as expressly permitted in this Agreement.  Except to the extent that any applicable mandatory laws prevent VMware restraining Licensee from doing so, Licensee will not, and will not permit any third party to, sublicense, rent, copy, modify, create derivative works of, translate, reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise reduce to human perceivable form any portion of the Technology Preview Software or accompanying Documentation.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Licensee shall not use the Technology Preview Software for Licensee’s product development or any other commercial purpose.  The Technology Preview Software and all performance data and test results, including without limitation, benchmark test results (collectively “Performance Data”)  relating to the Technology Preview Software are the Confidential Information of VMware, and will be treated in accordance with the terms of Section 4 of this Agreement.  Accordingly, Licensee shall not publish or disclose to any third party any Performance Data relating to the Technology Preview Software.

Upon any expiration or termination of rights with respect to the Technology Preview Software under this Agreement, the rights and licenses granted to Licensee under this Agreement shall immediately terminate, and Licensee shall immediately cease using, and will destroy or render practically inaccessible the Technology Preview Software, Documentation, and all other tangible items in Licensee’s possession or control that contain Confidential Information.

4.	CONFIDENTIALITY.  (a)  Confidentiality.  "Confidential Information" means the Technology Preview Software, all information regarding the Technology Preview Software (including any trade secrets, know-how, inventions, techniques, processes, and algorithms embodied in the Technology Preview Software), Documentation, Performance Data, any Updates, and other information provided by VMware to Licensee under this Agreement, whether disclosed orally, in writing, or by examination or inspection, other than information that Licensee can demonstrate (i) was already known to Licensee, other than under an obligation of confidentiality, at the time of disclosure; (ii) was generally available in the public domain at the time of disclosure to Licensee; (iii) became generally available in the public domain after disclosure other than through any act or omission of Licensee; (iv) was subsequently lawfully disclosed to Licensee by a third party without any obligation of confidentiality; or (v) was independently developed by Licensee without use of or reference to any information or materials disclosed by VMware or its suppliers.  If Licensee is required to disclose Confidential Information by applicable law or court order, Licensee shall notify VMware of the required disclosure promptly in writing and shall cooperate with VMware in any lawful action to contest or limit the scope of the required disclosure.  Confidential Information shall include, without limitation, any information relating to VMware products, product roadmaps, and other technical, business, financial and product development plans, forecasts and strategies.  Licensee shall not use any Confidential Information for any purpose other than as expressly authorized under this Agreement.  In no event shall Licensee use the Technology Preview Software or any Confidential Information to develop, manufacture, market, sell, or distribute any product or service, including any VMware products.  Licensee shall not disclose any Confidential Information to any third party. Without limiting the foregoing, Licensee shall use at least the same degree of care that it uses to prevent the disclosure of its own confidential information of like importance, but in no event less than reasonable care, to prevent the disclosure of such Confidential Information.   (b)  Additional Confidentiality Restrictions for Highly Confidential Technology Preview Software.  For certain Technology Preview Software designated by VMware as highly confidential (“Highly Confidential Technology Preview Software”) in VMware’s correspondence to you regarding this Technology Preview Software or in any Documentation, additional heightened confidentiality restrictions designated below will apply.  (i)  	Licensee shall limit dissemination of Highly Confidential Technology Preview Software and related information concerning product features, future technologies and roadmaps only to Information Technology teams and/or software/solutions development teams of Licensee designated by VMware, and only to individuals on those teams who have a need to know the Confidential Information for purposes expressly authorized under this Agreement.  For clarity and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Licensee shall not disseminate any Highly Confidential Technology Preview Software to Licensee's sales and marketing field organizations.  Licensee will assign an employee who will be primarily responsible (“Primary Contact”) for ensuring that the terms of this Agreement are complied with.   (ii)	 Licensee acknowledges that damages for improper disclosure of Highly Confidential Technology Preview Software or related information concerning product features, future technologies and roadmaps may be irreparable and that monetary damages would be inadequate to compensate VMware for any breach of this Agreement.  In the event that VMware reasonably believes that Licensee has disseminated certain of such Highly Confidential Technology Preview Software or related information concerning product features, future technologies and roadmaps to an unauthorized party, Licensee will be immediately removed from VMware’s Technology Preview Software program and will not be permitted to participate in any VMware Technology Preview Software program in the future.  Additionally, all rights and licenses granted to Licensee under this Agreement shall immediately terminate in accordance with Section 3 herein (Term and Termination).   (c) Remedies.  In addition to all other remedies available in law or otherwise, VMware is entitled to seek equitable relief, including injunctive relief, against the threatened breach of this Agreement or the continuation of any such breach.
